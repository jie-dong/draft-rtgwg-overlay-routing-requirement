1.  Introduction

   SD-WAN is currently widely used in the basic scenarios of one-hop
   interconnection between enterprise on-premises sites of branches,
   campuses, and even DCs.  With multi-cloud adoption, workloads are
   migrating to be hosted on clouds.  It is necessary for SD-WAN to
   interconnect multiple on-premises sites and multiple cloud sites
   seamlessly with the overlay routing technology.

   As the core network technology, overlay routing faces a series of new
   challenges during its evolution, such as flexible overlay topology
   formation and auto-provision, global interconnection among multi-
   regions via multi-ISP networks, and the SLA aware routing across
   multiple overlay segments.  Also, it is necessary to investigate how
   SD-WAN can be seamlessly integrated with the virtual network of
   multiple clouds.

2.  Terminology

   *  SD-WAN: Software Defined Wide Area Network.  In this document,
      "SD-WAN" refers to the policy-driven transporting of IP packets
      over multiple different underlay networks to get better WAN
      bandwidth management, visibility, and control.

   *  Site: Enterprise sites across different geo regions, where people
      or workload host, such as branches, campuses, or even clouds.

   *  Edge: The border devices of the SD-WAN site, which could be
      physical or virtual CPEs.

   *  TN: Transport Network, the underlay connectivity network which
      correspond to different ISP network between SD-WAN sites.

   *  TNP: Transport Network Port, the wan port of the Edge which
      connects to TN.

   *  Virtual Tunnel: The IP tunnel between two TNPs of two different
      edges from different sites.

2.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Virtual tunnel auto-discovery and provision requirement

   As the basis of the SD-WAN overlay network, virtual tunnels between
   edges should be established before the client routes exchange
   packets.  The virtual tunnels, such as IPSec tunnels, establishment
   between edges require extensive information exchange, such as public
   keys, tunnel endpoints properties, etc., which can significantly
   delay client route packet forwarding if they are not established
   ahead of time.  A virtual tunnel is a point-to-point forwarding
   relationship between two SD-WAN Edges across a given or multiple
   underlay ISP networks that provide a well-defined set of transport
   characteristics (e.g., delay, security, bandwidth, etc.

                         Figure 3: Layered topology

   Different enterprises often have different connectivity topologies
   with hundreds and thousands of tunnels, as shown in Figure 1,
   Figure 2 and Figure 3.  For the efficiency and simplicity of the O&M,
   it is highly expected to discover and establish the virtual tunnels
   between sites automatically instead of manually configuring the
   overlay tunnels one by one.

   [I-D.ietf-idr-sdwan-edge-discovery] has designed an efficient
   mechanism to exchange the information of each endpoint of the overlay
   tunnel by BGP protocol, by which edges could check and decide to
   establish the tunnel or not automatically.  While this mechanism
   works fine in reality, it can be further improved.  For example, it
   is much more expected to carry more information to reflect the
   topology intent (Full Mesh, P2MP, P2P) in BGP.

4.  Topology-aware routing with multi-hop overlay network requirement

   There are many differences in the control plane between the
   traditional L3 VPN network and the SD-WAN overlay network.  As per
   L3VPN network, IGP protocol (OSPF or ISIS) is deployed on each
   physical link between routers and is responsible for discovering the
   underlay network topology and calculating the routing of the BGP
   nexthops (often loopback0 of PEs), while BGP is deployed to advertise
   and calculate the VPN routes based on the IGP output.  In the SD-WAN
   overlay network, it is difficult and a not good choice to run IGP
   directly on the tunnels between edges because it will bring much more
   resource consumption. p2p tunnels, such as GRE or VXLAN, need to be
   configured using a virtual interface to run the IGP protocol.
   Flooding of the IGP message could cause resource waste in the control
   plane.

   For the SD-WAN overlay network, it is recommended to use BGP to
   discover the overlay topology and calculate the best overlay path,
   which is also responsible for advertising and calculating the VPN
   routes.

5.  SLA-aware routing across multiple overlay segments requirement

   After a multi-hop SD-WAN overlay network is established, such as the
   one shown in Figure 4 below, stitching together the overlay tunnels
   across the Edge1-Edge2-Edge5-Edge6 for the client traffic between
   Edge1 and Edge6 might provide better SLA than building other overlay
   tunnels between Edge1 and Edge6, such as Edge1-Edge2-Edge4-Edge6,
   etc.  Importing traffic engineering based routing in overlay network
   can provide more deterministic end-to-end QoS SLA for application.

                   +-------+      +-------+
         + --------| Edge2 |------| Edge4 |-----------+
         |         +-------+      +-------+           |
         |                  \    /                    |
     +-------+               \  /                 +-------+
     | Edge1 |                \/                  | Edge6 |
     +-------+                /\                  +-------+
         |                   /  \                     |
         |                  /    \                    |
         |         +-------+      +-------+           |
         +---------| Edge3 |------| Edge5 |-----------+
                   +-------+      +-------+

                   Figure 4: Example of SLA aware routing

   Different application flows have different SLA requirements.  For
   example, voice is sensitive to latency and jitter, while video
   requires a low packet loss forwarding path.  It is necessary to
   provide some degree of TE function to meet the requirements of
   different types of applications, which is a new challenge for the SD-
   WAN overlay networks.  Naturally, the centralized SD-WAN controller
   MUST collect SLA (latency, packet loss, and bandwidth) information of
   the tunnels and the overall topology to calculate the segment list
   satisfying the requirement raised by the application.  Further, the
   data plane that can carry the overlay tunnel list needs to be
   carefully designed with the consideration of efficiency and
   productivity.

6.  Seamless integration with virtual networks of multiple clouds
    requirement

   As more and more enterprises migrate their workloads to multiple
   clouds, it is highly expected to establish a high-quality
   interconnection between the enterprise's on-premise sites and the
   cloud sites with qualified O&M specification.

   It has been widely adopted to create vCPEs on the clouds as cloud
   edge to bring a uniform experience and O&M method for access to the
   clouds.  There are also obstacles discovered.  For example, how to
   integrate the multi VPN or multi-tenants to the virtual network of
   different clouds.  And for the sake of reliability, at least two
   vCPEs need to be created for each cloud site.  And it is often
   recommended to deploy VRRP between the two vCPEs, which need to run
   the VRRP control plane over multicast packets.  For the reason of
   security, many cloud service providers closed the native IP multicast
   services for the tenants.  So some new HA features need to be
   considered in such scenarios.

   Also, different cloud service provider implements different charge
   rule for the resources of the compute, network, etc.  It needs to be
   finely scrutinized to develop the most economical network solution
   for SD-WAN in cloud networks.

7.  Overlay multicast over multicast-free underlay networks requirement

   As more and more enterprise applications are running across SD-WAN
   overlay networks, multicast traffic is also emerging.  Different from
   traditional multicast VPN networks, SD-WAN overlay networks are based
   on multiple underlay ISP networks, such as internet, 5G, MPLS, etc
   which do not support multicast.  How to implement a multicast overlay
   network on top of the multicast-free underlay is challenging.
   Enhancement to the existing SD-WAN routing protocol needs to be made.
